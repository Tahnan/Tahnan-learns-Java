## Tahnan Tackles Project Euler (in Java)

At some point, probably back before I had started my first job as a programmer, I went through [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) in Python.  Well, as much of it as existed at the time (they've added a *lot* of problems since then), and also as much of it as was reasonably within the realms of "algorithms" and not into "advanced mathematical concepts".  (So, all but one of the first hundred, and then another fifty-odd of the next 250.)

I've returned to it as a way to practice Java.  I probably won't get very far; I suspect that after the first twenty problems or so it'll quickly become about language-agnostic things like program design, and less about Java-specific things like "set up a nested for-loop and break out of it as appropriate".  For now, though, it seems like a reasonable source of problems that aren't boring or trivial, but that are still tractable in a short program.
