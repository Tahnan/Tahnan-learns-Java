# Tahnan Learns Java

In case you've stumbled across this repository, allow me to explain its purpose.

I'm a really good Python programmer.  I started learning Python in the summer of 1997, back when it was 1.somethingorother.  I kept working with it while in academia, and eventually worked for over ten years as a professional Python developer.

Then in 2022 I changed jobs.  To one that uses Java.  Which I've hardly used since an intro class in 1996.

This repository, therefore, represents my ongoing attempts to reacclimatize myself to Java.  It's in a public place not because I think it represents the best of my work, but because I want to be able to point to it and ask people who are better Java programmers than I am, "What have I done wrong here?".

So I pray of you, O traveler: do not judge harshly what you see herein.
